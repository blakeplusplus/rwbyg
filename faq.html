<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<hr>
<h2>last /co/ general?</h2>
2258.
<h2>what day do new episodes come out?</h2>
every saturday. but we're in /trash/, so no new episodes for a while.
	
<h2>should i watch the show?</h2>
the show isn't good. it can be very bad sometimes, but sometimes it can really shine. most of the time it's just meh.</br>
just so you're aware though, the RWBY community in general sucks. there are some people who are really awesome, but for the most part it's not worth spending time in its community.</br>
you should consume some way better media that'll both help you understand how to do something right before using your time to watch RWBY.</br>
after that, go ahead and watch RWBY and just have fun.

<h2>why can't i read these comics? what's a .cbr/.cbz file?</h2>
cbr and cbz files are a comic book format file specifically for...comic books. works really well. you need an image viewer that can browse these. i personally use <a href="https://nomacs.org/">nomacs</a>

<h2>how can i request something to be added to the links page or website?</h2>
use <a href="https://github.com/czarchasm00/czarchasm00.github.io/tree/main">the github repository</a> and submit an issue
or contact me via discord

<h2>how do i make my own webms/gifs of RWBY?</h2>
I use <a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv, a free open-source media player</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ekisu/mpv-webm">a webm converter plugin for mpv</a> to easily make webms out of downloaded RWBY episodes. If you are masochistic/love a good command line, you can use <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>. You can also use <a href="https://gitgud.io/nixx/WebMConverter">WebMConverter</a> if you don't like command line. For gifs only, you can use <a href="https://glqv.bitbucket.io/rwby/gif-maker/">GLQ's GIFmaker</a> to pull from any episode publicly available.<br>
If any of this is too difficult for you, just request something in the thread.

<h2>how can i help the general?</h2>
<a href="https://paypal.me/czarchasm00">donate to me</a> to aid me in purchasing more exclusive japanese blurays to rip and upload. or some MEGAnons might have something for you. visit the /rwbyg/ discord and ask how you can help them (we work separately and occasionally work together)

<h2>who uploads the stuff to the MEGA links?</h2>
MEGAnons, and random anons sometimes. or sometimes someone outside the /rwbyg/sphere

<h2>why is rwby the only general allowed on /co/?</h2>
<a href="/images/modruling.png">mods said so.</a>

<h2>why does /rwbyg/ go to /trash/ every year during hiatus?</h2>
tl;dr some asshole that hated people doing greentext stories in RWBY /co/ threads focused his powers to spam other threads and get rwbyg banned off of /co/ during hiatus

<h2>why does this website exist?</h2>
the original pastebin was lacking in newer content, and if you wanted to add anything, you had to go into the discord server and ask. the pastebin owner rarely visits the threads so any requests had to be directly to him, and iirc, he's refused to add content before. i decided to take matters into my own hands and make my own collection of links using my wildly mediocre html/css skills (and attempt to improve them along the way).

<h2>who are you?</h2>
czarchasm#4106

<h2>Moral Code</h2>
previously, there was a whole section here on what I believe to be morally right when it comes to piracy and what i try to act by. this has been thrown out the window in light of <a href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1ss5f7p">recent events</a>.
i was wrong about RT. if I can, i'll try to support individual writers and people. but not this company anymore.
i was originally partial about RT because crunch culture is a big part of the industry, and something like this wasn't available. we had anonymous glassdoor reviews, but some of it was in question, and i'd be lying if i said i didn't turn a blind eye sometimes.
this is much too far though, and in this case, i very much believe kdin.
to those who have been trying to say this to me for a while, i apologize, and i appreciate you fighting the good fight.
