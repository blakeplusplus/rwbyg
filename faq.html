<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<hr>
<h2>last /co/ general?</h2>
2258.
<h2>what day do new episodes come out?</h2>
every saturday. but we're in /trash/, so no new episodes for a while.
<h2>should i watch the show?</h2>
the show isn't good. it can be very bad sometimes, but sometimes it can really shine. most of the time it's just meh.</br>
just so you're aware though, the RWBY community in general sucks. there are some people who are really awesome, but for the most part it's not worth spending time in its community.</br>
you should consume some way better media that'll both help you understand how to do something right before using your time to watch RWBY.</br>
after that, go ahead and watch RWBY and just have fun.

<h2>why can't i read these comics? what's a .cbr/.cbz file?</h2>
cbr and cbz files are a comic book format file specifically for...comic books. works really well. you need an image viewer that can browse these. i personally use <a href="https://nomacs.org/">nomacs</a>

<h2>how can i request something to be added to the links page or website?</h2>
put it in the thread. note that i use filters to filter out shitty posts. i recommend you put your request as your own post as to try not to trigger the filter.

<h2>how do i make my own webms/gifs of RWBY?</h2>
I use <a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv, a free open-source media player</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ekisu/mpv-webm">a webm converter plugin for mpv</a> to easily make webms out of downloaded RWBY episodes. If you are masochistic/love a good command line, you can use <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>. You can also use <a href="https://gitgud.io/nixx/WebMConverter">WebM for Retards</a> if you don't like command line. For gifs only, you can use <a href="https://glqv.bitbucket.io/rwby/gif-maker/">GLQ's GIFmaker</a> to pull from any episode publicly available.<br>
If any of this is too difficult for you, just request something in the thread.

<h2>how can i help the general?</h2>
<a href="https://paypal.me/czarchasm00">donate to me</a> to aid me in purchasing more exclusive japanese blurays to rip and upload. or some MEGAnons might have something for you. visit the /rwbyg/ discord and ask how you can help them (we work separately and occasionally work together)

<h2>who uploads the stuff to the MEGA links?</h2>
MEGAnons, and random anons sometimes. or sometimes someone outside the /rwbyg/sphere

<h2>why is rwby the only general allowed on /co/?</h2>
<a href="/images/modruling.png">mods said so.</a>

<h2>why does /rwbyg/ go to /trash/ every year during hiatus?</h2>
tl;dr some sperg that hated people doing greentext stories in RWBY /co/ threads focused his autism to spam other threads and get rwbyg banned off of /co/ during hiatus

<h2>why are there so many damn namefags, tripfags, and discordfags?</h2>
for namefags/tripfags, some of them provide actual quality to the threads with custom artwork or fanfiction. others are just retarded and provide nothing of value other than ruining part of the fun of 4chan. for discordfags, there is a /rwbyg/ discord server. im not personally in it, nor do i like it, but if that's your cup of tea go nuts. spoiler alert: it's basically just /rwbyg/ except everyone's a tripfag.

<h2>why does this website exist?</h2>
the original pastebin was lacking in newer content, and if you wanted to add anything, you had to go into the discord server and ask. the pastebin owner rarely visits the threads so any requests had to be directly to him, and iirc, he's refused to add content before. i decided to take matters into my own hands and make my own collection of links using my wildly mediocre html/css skills (and attempt to improve them along the way).

<h2>Moral Code</h2>
i've been criticized before for having a really terrible code of morals concerning piracy, so i think it's worth it to try and define a public code of morals on piracy to help keep myself in check.
</br></br>
General Statement: Piracy is meant for preservation, circumventing bullshit gatekeeping and/or anti-consumer business practices.
</br>
<ol>
<li>Pirating content that is offered digitally that allows the user to OWN the content without much work is bad.</li>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Max amount of effort would be using a program like youtube-dl.</li>
		<li>If the content that is offered officially is in lower quality compared to the pirate's service, it is okay to pirate.</li>
		<li>The only exception to this rule is something like Steam; any company that is "too big to fail" AND has a history of keeping titles in their marketplace.</li>
		<li>Time-gated content done not out of excessive greed OR with a short time gap (less than a month) is not okay to pirate. RWBY is a good example.</li>
	</ol>
<li>Physical media, especially that which has a chance of being lost forever, MUST be ripped and shared freely without gatekeeping.</li>
<li>Advertising/recommending to pirate something excessively, especially when you did not rip it yourself, is bad.</li>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>This website circumvents this rule by not being advertised (except sometimes to a select few privately).</li>
	</ol>
<li>Providing a middleman service for pirated content is okay if there exists another party who would do the same thing as you anyway.</li>	
<li>Price gouging or other anti-consumer practices warrants piracy.</li>
<li>Free content locked behind a sign-up page warrants piracy.</li>
<li>Content released by pirates that falls outside of this specified moral code should not be respected.</li>
<li>Pirates who have released content do NOT deserve to place arbitrary restrictions or limitations on their products. This includes leaked summaries, BluRay rips, etc.</li>
<li>Above all else, always recommend to users to support the original creators when doing any service relating to piracy.</li>
</ol>
