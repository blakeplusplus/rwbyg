<h1>Overview</h1>
Ripped directly from BluRay, encoded through Handbrake. H.265 1080p, framerate set same as source.<br>
This rip uses the .mkv file format, with all CRWBY commentaries contained on separate audio tracks. You <strong>WILL</strong> need a video player that can play .mkvs.<br>
<strong>Support the original creators please.</strong>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<a class="qst">Q:</a> <em>Why is only V2 and V4 available?</em><br>
<a class="ans">A:</a> I'm very particular about the quality of my releases, so I only get the BluRays in brand new condition, still sealed. I don't trust overseas sellers to include everything in the box unless it's new, and these BluRays are also for my personal collection. As such, it takes a lot of time and money. V2 cost me around $120, and V4 cost me $155. I currently have V1, V3, and V5 in my possession ready to rip, but I just haven't had much passion for RWBY lately. I'll do it soon, I promise.<br><br>

<a class="qst">Q:</a> <em>Why are all these files not in mp4 format? I can't play them?</em><br>
<a class="ans">A:</a> MKV offers the excellent advantage of being able to select audio tracks and subtitle tracks, while MP4 does not. For these files, you need to be able to select audio tracks to switch between crew/cast/whatever commentary version and original dub. Download VLC, MPV, or any media player that supports MKV. Otherwise, you will NOT be able to watch the crew commentaries. <strong>No exceptions.</strong><br><br>

<a class="qst">Q:</a> <em>Why are these in movie format and not episodic format like your other releases?</em><br>
<a class="ans">A:</a> That's how it came out when I ripped it. Normally, the BluRays have an episodic format version and a movie format version, but the Japanese release ONLY has movie format. Cutting it up into their original episodes would take way too much time and effort, and are generally not worth it.</strong><br><br>

<a class="qst">Q:</a> <em>Where are these files/subtitles sourced from?</em><br>
<a class="ans">A:</a> They are ripped directly from the Japanese "First" Limited Edition BluRays.<br><br>

<a class="qst">Q:</a> <em>What tools did you use?</em><br>
<a class="ans">A:</a> <ul>
	<li> <a href="https://makemkv.com/">MakeMKV</a>: Rip contents of the BluRay discs to a digital format</li>
		<ul><li>Be sure to change minimum time to 0 so you can get all video files no matter the length.</li></ul>
	<li> <a href="https://www.leawo.com/blu-ray-player/">Leawo BluRay Player</a>: Play BluRays as intended, allowing you to see titles of videos so you can name them correctly in the release. Wish I had something better, but this is all I can find that includes BluRay menus and does not just autoplay the files found on the disc.</li>
	<li> <a href="https://mkvtoolnix.download/">MKVToolNix</a>: Collection of tools used for MKV files. I mainly use it for separating English captions from English BluRays to add to Japanese BluRay releases.</li>
	<li> <a href="https://www.nikse.dk/SubtitleEdit/">SubtitleEdit:</a>: Best subtitle editor available. Really good at messing with offsets and doing basic subtitle work (this is necessary for portions of Japanese releases pre-V5 and full releases V5 and onwards).</li>
	<li> <a href="https://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a>: Encode video to decrease file sizes, include different tracks as well as name them, and do other QoL stuff.</li>
		<ul><li>Preset used is available <a href="https://rwbyg.com/RWBY_Preset.json">here.</a> Be sure to add audio and subtitle tracks as needed.</li></ul>
